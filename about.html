      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>My name is Nicholas Harrison. I was originally born in Texas, but I have lived in sunny Naples, Florida for nearly 15 years now. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU).
      <br />
      <br />
      When I graduate, I hope to work in the aerospace industry, particularly in astronautics. I have always loved space, and would love even more to work on a project that aids humankind in further exploring the vast expanse that is space.
