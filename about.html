        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Nicholas Harrison. I was born in Texas, but I have lived in sunny Naples, Florida for nearly 15 years now. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU).
        <br />
        <br />
        When I graduate, I hope to work in the aerospace industry, particularly in astronautics. I have always loved space, and would love even more to work on a project that aids humankind in further exploring the vast expanse that is space.
        </p>

        <h2>My Motivation</h2>
        <p>I've always believed that, as humans, we are stronger than we ever believe. Sometimes, we all need an extra push and I have used some of the content below to help me with that. </p>
        <video width="400" controls>
          <source src="video/miamiVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>I often find looking at beautiful scenes like this one, from Miami (across the state from me), helps me to think of the same view I could have one day, if I work hard enough.</p>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="content/speech.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        <p>But sometimes, beauty is not enough. Ferocious motivational speeches like this one help keep me moving when the alternative does not.</p>
